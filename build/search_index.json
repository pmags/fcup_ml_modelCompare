To achieve our goal we stacked against each other pairs of different models using Synthetic Datasets represents often polarizing and extreme situations and therefore exposing the main decision characteristics of each model. The focus will be solely on classification problems and models will be compared againts each other using Accuracy and Area under the Roc Curve (AUC ROC) as metrics. Since we have full control over the dataset distributuion, the optimal Bayes Boundary willbe used as baseline Project structure This project is organized in the following way: An introduction containing general assumptions and how to reproduce the results, A chapter for each model pair containing the sythetic data rules, the bayes optimal boundary (BOB), a small models explanation and rational for each dataset, model fit and metrics as well as the prediction area and discussion of the results, An overall conclusion Approaches and Assumptions Throughtout this project the following assumptions were made and approaches were used: Dependent variables (target) are of date type factor and all Independent variables (features) are of type numeric, Since the datasets are syntheticly generated, no pre-processing was made, Datasets were built using statistical distributions and/or classification rules which may have no resemblance to reality, To the extant it is possible a dataset was created using a binomial categorical variable and a two features, For the sake of molde comparing, the default hyperparameter value were used. This are provided by Parsnip R package without post-processing and hyperparameter optimzation. It is possible, although unlikely, that a different package or under different hyperparameters could result different conclusions, For calculating metrics a crossvalidatios with 10 folds and no repetition was used. How to run and reproduce the conclusions "],["logistic-vs-knn.html", "1 logistic vs knn 1.1 Dataset definition 1.2 Model fitting 1.3 Compare results 1.4 Conclusion", " 1 logistic vs knn 1.1 Dataset definition When comparing a Logistic regression model agains a Nearest Neighbour model we are comparing a highly biased and a very flexible approach. While a logostic regression assumes a linear border between both classes, NN makes no assumptions and and relies on local information (by k neighbours) to predict a class. Given the base assumption of a linear boundary by logistic regression, a model whose border differs, substantially from a line we expect will performe badly. On the other hand the lack of linearity wont an issue for knn. Therefore, we built two datasets with 1000 observations from a Uniform Distribution, one with a classification provided by a linear model of \\(X1 &gt;= X2\\) and a narrow quadratic function \\(abs(1,2 * X_{1} - 5)^2 + 2\\). decision_fun_linear &lt;- function(x1, x2){ res &lt;- ifelse(x2 &gt;= x1, 1, 0) return(res) } decision_fun_quadratic &lt;- function(x1, x2){ res &lt;- ifelse(x2 &gt;= abs( (1.2 * x1 - 5)^2 + 2 ), 1, 0) return(res) } dataset_linear &lt;- dataset_gen_unif(class_fun = decision_fun_linear, size = 1000) dataset_quadratic &lt;- dataset_gen_unif(class_fun = decision_fun_quadratic, size = 1000) grid.arrange( dataset_linear$border_plot, dataset_quadratic$border_plot, nrow = 1, top = &quot;Synthetic Generated Datasets&quot;, bottom = grid::textGrob( &quot;Dashed line represent optimal bayes decision border&quot;, gp = grid::gpar(fontface = 3, fontsize = 9) ) ) 1.2 Model fitting Each dataset was divided on training and test dataset using a 80/20 split. # 0.

That is visible on both the training and test dataset although with an edge towards the logistic regression. It is when the boundary aliviates the linearity condition that knn really outshines the logistic output. It is important to notice that given the fact that the data derive from such strong definitions, it lakes randomness and therefore its not easy to identify signs of overfitting.
